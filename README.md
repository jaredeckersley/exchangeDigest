# exchangeDigest
Create a daily digest from MS Exchange 2010 mailbox and create phpBB3 posts from each unique email. The phpBB3 posts are created as the as the sender in the email from field and attachments are also supported.

This script is not very polished. It was a proof of concept that I developed, but was never put into production. I like the idea of it though. Being able to have a single digest of all emails and a forum entry for each individual email might be the right solution for someone.

If you like the idea and need help getting this to work, send me an email - jared@jaredeckersley.com
